## Introduction

**[OutOfAmmo]** is a sniper assassin game where your objective is to assasinate your targets. Unfortunatly for you, you only have a single ammunition to execute your mission, which means that if you miss you need to find a clever solution to the difficulty you have put yourself in. The game is designed in [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the 3D models are designed in [blender](https://www.blender.org/) with some imported from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed). Finally our animations are from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)

## Features

- **[3 maps]**: [Our game includes 3 maps with the objective to assasinate one target on each map.]
- **[Sniper]**: [At the start of each map you will attempt to shoot the target, there is unfortunatly for you a mechanic that makes you miss]
- **[Movement]**: [After you miss your only shot you will need to move to the target to punch it down and succeed with your objective that way. There is both slide and sprint which will help you move faster]
